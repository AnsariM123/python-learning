<h2> Welcome to 90 Days of Machine Learning Code</h2> 
<h4> This is a daily, hands-on, beginner-to-advanced roadmap designed to help you build real-world ML skills, one day at a time </h4>

<h3> Whether you're a Student, Developer, Data Analyst, ML Engineer and want to start learning or solidify your concepts and skill in Machine Learning, you are at a right place. From data preprocessing to deep learning and NLP with Transformers, you'll write code, complete projects, and learn the tools that power the future â€” in just 90 days.</h3>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Why This Challenge?</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:18px;">Because machine learning is not just the future â€” it's the now.</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;">And the best way to learn it is by doing. </li>
<li style="font-size:18px;">This isn't just another course â€” it's a movement.</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;">A commitment.</li>
<li style="font-size:18px;">A path that turns you into the engineer, creator, or thinker you aspire to be.</li>
</ul>


<h3>ðŸš€ What You'll Do</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Master essential ML concepts step-by-step</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Build 10+ real-world projects </li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Work with cutting-edge tools (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Deploy your models to the web</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Create a GitHub portfolio to showcase your work</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">And most importantly... never code alone</li>
</ul>


<h3>ðŸ§  Who This is For</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Beginners starting their ML journey</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Developers leveling up their skills</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Creators building content around data</li>
<li style="font-size:19px;">Anyone who believes in learning by doing</li>
</ul>
